NEW:
Energy system - Creatures loose energy over time, faster if moving, slower if idle. If energy reaches 0 they die. To prevent this, they must eat to regain energy.

BUG FIXES:
Creatures no longer get stuck at the world border at random.

Current progress:
Project is progressing well, looking promising to finish in given time limit.
Next I just need to write up this section on word, then fix performance issues, probably using delta time instead of frames to fix weird behaviors involving creatures constantly changing speed when performance drops.
After that, creature reproduction!
